      This is a web application dedicated to create a platform that makes it easier to both offer and
      find the cleaning services of your choice in your vicinity. The application gives the opportunity for
      everybody to create a profile to display their services, experience, and costs, and ensures time for
      one to find cleaning people in a much less time-consuming way. Ratings will be given for and from both
      sides so that each side can improve on their short-comings and build more reliable profiles in the
      future, allowing for an interactive environment centered around something we all need continuously
      in our lives: cleaning.

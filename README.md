# Cleaning Service Web App: ANDY

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/andysoftware/CleaningService.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/andysoftware/CleaningService)

<pre> This is a web application dedicated to create a platform that makes it easier to both offer and 
find the cleaning services of your choice in your vicinity. The application gives the opportunity for 
everybody to create a profile to display their services, experience, and costs, and ensures time for 
one to find cleaning people in a much less time-consuming way. Ratings will be given for and from both 
sides so that each side can improve on their short-comings and build more reliable profiles in the 
future, allowing for an interactive environment centered around something we all need continuously 
in our lives: cleaning.
